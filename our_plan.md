# Some Goals

## Long Term

- Do we have to care about the crazy camels?
   - Probably not, chances are so low for them to carry anything.
- What strategies should we use when laying the desert tiles?
   - Play to your overall bids and against your opponents'.
- Get simulation with inputs given simulation - something we can play games using.
- How do we decide how "good" something is?
- Use probability computations to generalize to other situations.
- Can information about some situations apply to others?  For example:
    ```
    x
    x _ x
    ```
    to
    ```
    x
    x
    x _ x
    ```
- :star: General strategy per leg of race.
    - On average how many turns will it take for the game to end?
    - How does number of players affect number of turns?
- Is it correct to avoid bidding on camels in the middle of the pack?
- When should you place your cards for winning/losing bids?
    - Matt D: when camels are in 4-8 range? Allows you to play your game based on your bets.

## Short Term

- get github desktop app installed, permissions granted and repo cloned
- get Matt G's simulation code on github
- write up Kyle's probability information
- add Kyle's write-up to github
